This driver is libUSB-based, and therefore does not require a kernel module, so may still remain preferable in some cases. However, it is not maintained, so please only work with this code if you know what you're doing. Prefer the official driver at http://sourceforge.net/projects/drivernovationl/

Launchpadd provides linux support to the novation launchpad.

This uses a libusb based daemon which can be integrated into an executable, and a midi front end to allow midi compatible programs to access the launchpad.
